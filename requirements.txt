# AI Music Generation

This project is an AI-powered music generation system that composes original music using deep learning (LSTM networks).

## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download a dataset of MIDI files and extract musical notes from them.

3. Train the model and save weights:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Generate music:
   ```sh
   python ai_music_generation.py
   ```

## Output
The generated music will be saved as `output.mid`, which can be played with any MIDI player.
